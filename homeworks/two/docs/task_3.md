# Analysis

**Objective:** To critically evaluate the performance and scalability of the implemented Hadoop and Spark solutions, and to explore real-world applications of these technologies within the context of Federated Learning.

**Instructions:**

1. **Performance and Scalability Analysis:**
    * **Hadoop Implementation:**
        * Analyze the execution time of your Hadoop MapReduce job.
        * Discuss how the job's performance might change with larger datasets or an increased number of clients.
        * Consider the impact of the shuffle and reduce phases on performance.
        * Comment on the resource utilization of your Hadoop cluster during job execution.
    * **Spark Implementation:**
        * Analyze the execution time of your Spark application.
        * Discuss the scalability of your Spark solution, particularly in terms of handling a larger number of simulated clients and federated learning rounds.
        * Compare and contrast the performance of Spark with your Hadoop implementation, highlighting the factors contributing to any observed differences.
        * Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using Spark and Hadoop in the context of the simulated federated learning scenario that was implemented.
2. **Federated Learning Challenges and Benefits:**
    * Discuss the challenges encountered when using Hadoop and Spark for Federated Learning tasks. Consider issues such as data partitioning, communication overhead, and fault tolerance.
    * Analyze the benefits of using these technologies in a Federated Learning setting, such as their ability to handle large datasets and perform distributed computations.
    * Specifically, discuss the advantages and disavantages of using Hadoop and Spark for the initial data aggregation, and global model aggregation, that was implemented in the previous steps.
3. **Real-World Application and Framework Research (Master & PhD Students):**
    * Read and prepare report for [Flotta](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13473).
    * Research and identify a real-world example or a framework (e.g., [Flotta](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13473)) that utilizes Spark or Hadoop principles in Federated Learning.
    * Provide a concise description of the chosen example or framework, focusing on how Spark or Hadoop is used.
    * Discuss the specific Federated Learning tasks that are addressed by the example or framework.
    * Cite all resources used in your research.

**Deliverables:**

1. **Written Analysis:**
    * A comprehensive written analysis of the performance and scalability of your Hadoop and Spark implementations.
    * A discussion of the challenges and benefits of using these technologies in a Federated Learning setting.
2. **Real-World Example Description: (Master & PhD Students)**
    * A detailed description of the researched real-world example or framework.
    * All citations.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

* The analysis will be evaluated based on its depth, clarity, and critical thinking.
* The real-world example description will be assessed for accuracy and relevance (Master & PhD Students).
* Citations will be assessed for completeness (Master & PhD Students).

**Guidance:**

* Provide specific examples and data points to support your analysis.
* Consider the trade-offs between performance and scalability in your discussion.
* Focus on the practical implications of your findings in the context of Federated Learning.
