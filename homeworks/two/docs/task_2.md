# Spark: Global Model Aggregation and Update

**Objective:** To utilize Spark for aggregating client-level data and simulating federated averaging, demonstrating its capability in distributed model aggregation.

**Instructions:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
    * You will be working with the aggregated results generated from the previous Hadoop MapReduce task.
    * Alternatively, if you encounter difficulties with the Hadoop output, you may simulate the aggregated results in the following format: `(client_id, (sum_of_feature_value, count))`. For example: `("client1", (123.4, 10)), ("client2", (256.7, 15)), ("client3", (389.1, 20))`.
    * Use Spark (either PySpark or Scala) to read or create an RDD/DataFrame containing these aggregated results.

2. **Global Average Computation:**
    * Write Spark code to compute the global average of the `feature_value` based on the client-level aggregations.
    * The global average should be calculated as: `(total_sum_of_feature_values) / (total_count)`.

3. **Federated Averaging Simulation:**
    * Extend your Spark code to simulate multiple rounds (e.g., 3-5 rounds) of federated averaging.
    * For each round:
        * Calculate the global average.
        * Simulate local updates for each client. For simplicity, you can simulate a local update by adding a random number (e.g., a small value generated from a normal distribution) to each client's local average (sum/count).
        * Recalculate the global average based on these simulated local updates.
        * Output the global average at the end of each round.

**Example Conceptual PySpark Code Snippet:**

Note: this is an example code (which might not work), you have to write the code based on your own knowledge and data.

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext
import random

sc = SparkContext("local", "FederatedAveraging")

# Simulate aggregated results (or read from Hadoop output)
data = [("client1", (123.4, 10)), ("client2", (256.7, 15)), ("client3", (389.1, 20))]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

# Calculate initial global average
total_sum = rdd.map(lambda x: x[1][0]).sum()
total_count = rdd.map(lambda x: x[1][1]).sum()
global_average = total_sum / total_count

print(f"Initial Global Average: {global_average}")

# Simulate federated averaging rounds
for round_num in range(3):
    local_averages = rdd.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1][0] / x[1][1])).collect()
    print(f"Round {round_num + 1} Local Averages: {local_averages}")

    # Simulate local updates
    updated_averages = [(client, avg + random.uniform(-1, 1)) for client, avg in local_averages]
    print(f"Round {round_num + 1} Updated Averages: {updated_averages}")

    # Recalculate global average
    global_average = sum([avg for client, avg in updated_averages]) / len(updated_averages)
    print(f"Round {round_num + 1} Global Average: {global_average}")

sc.stop()
```

**Deliverables:**

1. **Spark Code**: Submit your PySpark or Scala code file.
2. **Execution Screenshots**: Provide screenshots demonstrating the Spark job execution.
3. **Global Average Results**: Include the final global average result and the global average results from each round of federated averaging.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

* Code will be assessed for correctness, clarity, and efficiency.
* Screenshots and output will be evaluated for completeness and accuracy.
* Code should be well-documented with clear comments (NOT BY GPT TOOLS).

**Guidance:**

* Ensure your Spark environment is properly configured.
* Utilize Spark's debugging tools and web UI to monitor job execution.
* Pay attention to data types and transformations to avoid errors.
